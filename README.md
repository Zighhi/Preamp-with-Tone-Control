# Preamp-with-Tone-Control
Active James Tonestack 

Design and practically build an audio frequency preamplifier with tone correction having the following features: Unipolar (VCC = 14 V) or bipolar (VCC = 12 V, VEE = -VCC = -12V) supply voltage. Signaling the presence of voltage with LED. Alternating input voltage with an amplitude of 10mV. Frequency band between low_freq = 200 Hz and high_freq = 6 kHz. Neutral center frequency for the tonestack N = 2 kHz. BAXANDALL type tone correction or equivalent with Â±12 dB. Voltage gain at neutral frequency 100, equivalent to 40 dB. Output resistance equal to the load resistance of some 600 Ohm headphones
